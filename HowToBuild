How to Build for Android
------------------------

Prerequisites:

1. Android SDK >= 4.03

2. Android NDK >= r4b

3. Apache Ant >= 1.7.0

4. (Windows-only) Cygwin >= 1.7

For those who use Eclipse for Android development (most of you), jump to Part B

To build:

1. Create 'local.properties' file containing sdk.dir && ndk.dir definitions:
	sdk.dir=<path to the Android SDK folder>
	ndk.dir=<path to the Android NDK folder>
E.g., on my computer 'local.properties' consists of 2 lines:
  sdk.dir=/Users/geometer/android-sdk-mac_86
  ndk.dir=/Users/geometer/android-ndk-r4b

2. Create a new folder 'developerSpecific' in assets folder.In that folder, Create 'developer.properties' file, that contains:
        developerKey='your bookshare developer key'
	bugSenseKey='your bugsense key'
	optOutGoogleAnalytics='your choice'

  If you want to access bookshare library, you will have to obtain a bookshare developer key at http://developer.bookshare.org.
  You can also optionally enter your Bugsense key to get crash reports.
 
 A sample file would be:
    developerKey=abcdefgh123456789abcdefg
	bugSenseKey=abcd12
	optOutGoogleAnalytics=false

3. If you use Linux or MacOS, just run 'ant clean debug' to create an installable package that will provide debugging info.

If you are Windows user
  3a. Run ndk-build (a program from Android NDK directory) in your project directory;
      This program only runs from Cygwin >= 1.7, please read NDK docs for details.
      Read and try config cygwin using 'cygwin_installation_and_configuration.pdf'
  3b. Run 'ant release'.

4. Sign your package manually.

Part B
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download the project code from git onto your local drive "git clone git://github.com/benetech/FBReaderJ.git".
2. Create or change the local.properties file to point to your Android SDK and NDK installations.  It should be at
   the root of your project.
3. If you are running Linux or Mac OS, run "ant package" from inside the project directory containing build.xml.
   You may get some compile errors around the zip4j and bookshare classes, but don't worry at this point, since we
   will build with Eclipse.  If you are still having issues, you may want to run 'ant clean debug' 
   If you are running Windows, 
   - Run ndk-build (a program from Android NDK directory) in your project directory;
      This program only runs from Cygwin >= 1.7, please read NDK docs for details.

   Make sure directories res/raw and res/drawable get created and are populated.
   These newly created resource directories are mandatory for creating an Eclipse project.
4. Import the project code into a new Eclipse project via: New -> Other -> Android Project from Existing Code
5. Put the .jar files in the /libs directory in the build path (present in FBReaderJ directory).  In Eclipse this
   is best done from FBReader->Properties->Java Build Path->Add JARs for both JAR files.  This step should remove
   all the errors mentioned in the step 3.
6. To enable use of the Bookshare library, you need to obtain a developer key at http://developer.bookshare.org.
   One you have an application key, you need to enter it into
   org.geometerplus.android.fbreader.network.bookshare.BookshareDeveloperKey.java
7. Build from within Eclipse  or 'ant clean debug' to build an installable .apk file
8. The signed apk will be present in the /bin folder which can be installed on the Android device/emulator.

Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One common reason the build steps mentioned in Part A may fail is because 
the Android SDK and NDK locations in local.properties might not be correct.

Running the ndk-build enables compiles the native part of the code and creates shared object (.so) files.

The Bookshare-API, zip4j_1.1.1.7, and other libraries in /lib should be included in the build path in the Eclipse project.
This should remove the compilation errors and the apk file will be created after project is built in Eclipse.
